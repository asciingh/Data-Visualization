their death and also make people aware of their sacrifices over the
years

\#Requirements This display meets requirements for D4.

*Display 1: Journalist Killings by Year and Type*

I made the use of a sample bar graph instead of a line graph as it was
visually easier to see the impact. I also looked up the various wars
that took place during this time to help see the trends in the death
tolls. Since this graph is showing deaths, I made sure to not use
neutral colours to not put off the user.I chose to remove one of the
levels of the category since it added nothing to the interpretation. I
also chose not to add a visual or a cartoon since I thought it would go
against seriousness I am trying to show. (Dragga and Voss,
[2001](#ref-DraggaVoss), 271)

In 1992, the Iraqi No-Fly Zone Operation began, as a result, there is an
increase in death toll in 1993 and 1994. After seeing a decrease till
2002, we see that it starts to rise up again due to the resurgence of
the Iraq War that restarted in 2003.

We can notice that in 2009, we see the highest recorded deaths. A lot of
it being murders. This can be linked to the Gaza conflict between Israel
and Palestine which to this day has brutal consequences. 2009 also saw
the rise of Boko Haram in Africa which is also responsible for the high
death toll.

2011 saw the last part of the Iraqi insurgency continue and the
beginning of the Syrian Civil War which went on till 2014 adding to the
death tolls.

2014 had the Iraqi and Libyan Civil wars which is still ongoing.

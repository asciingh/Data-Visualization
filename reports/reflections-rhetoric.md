## reflections on rhetoric

**Prompt:** For each of the two authors you select, reflect on their
ideas and their messages. What is the most significant idea you can
borrow from them that you can apply to your own portfolio? Make your
responses as specific as you can.

**Response:** Maps of emotion - Eric Rodenbeck He tried to show hard
hitting topics of US army troops based on location and hometowns. It
gave a graphic which was heavy to look at. He also looked at immigration
trends in America. It was interesting to learn how to represent death
and how going with neutral colours can ease the viewers mind. It was
also interesting to see how one can emphasize certain points.

**Response:** Show ideas and evidence - Jonathan Corum Jon wantes to
build context around a visualization which is important if the user does
not have any knowlege about it. Jon had to pull extra sources to get
what he wants so knowing about that helped me as a viewer. Eric on the
other hand tried to make it personable. By adding personal experience he
makes the viewer more involved in the graph. It was great to see the
final graph since that was the first time I could see the art in making
graphs.

## Requirements
This display meets requirements for D2.

- Observations :500 after sampling
- Quantitative variable: Purchase: Amount in dollars purchased
- Qualitative variable: Occupation (1-20),
                        Age (7 categories)
                        City Category (A,B,C)

*Display 1: Multiway Plot of Black Friday Customers based on Age and Occupation*


The data for this graph was really large hence I had to sample it. I chose sampling without replacement to get discrete data. I also refactored the categories to the Purchase column to sort out the data points.[@Robbins2013a, 200] The use of colour here is beneficial as it clearly helps us distinguish between the different cities. The distinct colours are used for that purpose. 

One can instantly see that BlackFriday attracts maximum amount of people from 25-45 age group. For this same age group Occupations 1,7 and 4 are quite common. We can also see that a lot of the B City population is quite spread out throughout the occupations.


In conclusion, we wanted to see what age group is the most targeted during Black Friday and we can conlude by saying that it is the 25-45 age group as the end up doing a large portion of the purchases

##week 10 reading prompt
##week 8 reading prompt

Kostelnick, Charles (2007) The visual rhetoric of data displays: The conundrum
of clarity. *IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication* 50(2): 280--294.

**Prompt:** 
Different facets of the graph  ? 
**Response:** 
Too little or too much on the graph. ethos logos pathos kairos. Need to include the pathos as well.
Rhetoric of science:- 


**Prompt:** 
How does the author describe other communities?
**Response:**
Members of a community rarely care about different ideas from other communities. It is important to know if where they belong changes the way you look at things.


**Prompt:**
Rhetoric of participation?

**Response:** 
Making things interactive and giving the audience an option to see what they want. accept different readers find different things credible.

**Prompt:**
Rhetoric of adaptation?

**Response:** 
Change context and complexity of the graph based on technical knowledge of the audience. Expert vs layman


**Prompt:**
Rhetoric of science?

**Response:** 
Misconception: there is only 1 truth and people should see that.



**Prompt:**
Social Rhetoric?

**Response:** 
What is all the baggage the the audience brings with them. All of the preconceptions with the audience      

##week 6 reading prompt
Dragga, Sam & Dan Voss (2001) Cruel pies: The inhumanity of technical
illustrations. *Technical Communication* 48(3): 265--274.

**Prompt:** Explain how the prevalent treatment of ethics in visual communication is lacking.

**Response:** 
So far wherever the issus of misguidance has been brought up, it has been related to accuracy and validity. Most of the books that cover ethics in visualization usually only talk about graph distortion and honesty instead of deception. This ends up being not enough.


**Prompt:** Explain the purpose of "humanizing" data displays depicting human suffering or death. 

**Response:**  
By omitting the human misery caused by that militarycampaign,  the  illustration  could  be  said  to  constitute  adistortion  of  the  reality  that  escapes  the  statistics.  Thegraphic isn’t so much deceptive, however, as it is plainlyinhumane—insensitive or indifferent to the human condi-tion it depicts. It is a graphic that exhibits the “ethic ofexpediency” (Katz 1992).

By humanizing the data we are making sure that we are not omitting the human misery. If we do then the figure is distorted of its reality. When we do not see the people we do not see the suffering so it is difficult to understand the gravity of the situation.


**Prompt:**  Consider the authors' attempts at redesigning such data displays. Did one in particular strike you as ineffective? Explain    

**Response:** 

I feel the cold statistics did not do the best job at humanizing. Here I feel it was not important to add a picture since cold is not severe enough for us to humanize it. The cold picture is also misleading since it is not clear what the person in bed is doing and if it requires explaining, not worth it.


**Prompt:**  Did one in particular strike you as effective? Explain. 
The babies graph was effective since just a plain histograph is insensitive towards falling babies and does not show the gravity of the situation.


**Response:** 










##week 4 reading prompt
## week 2 reading prompts  



**Prompt:** Tufte says, "Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of the
accident, there was a clear proximate cause." Summarize Tufte's explanation 
of the proximate cause.  

**Response:** 
While everone was looking at the problem from different angles, Tufte claims the main reason for the failure was the inability to assess the link between link temperatures and O ring damage. He states this with the help of many graphs that were shown before the day of the launch. One of the charts lacked the names of the authors of the chart that might cause lack in credibility. One of them talks about the same rocket with 3 different names which can lead to confusion and issues like these that fail to capture the relationship with temperature.

**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those ideas.

**Response:**  
The first chart does not have names which takes out the possibility of communication and credibility check with the authors. The second chart talks about Oring damage but the chart does not say anything about the cause of the damage (temp). It also has 3 different names for the same rocket so it causes confusion among readers. Another chart talsk about the relationship between erosion of primary ring and secondary ring. it was odd that even this graph the temp is not mentioned although other visual representation is covered.

**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What data 
were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in making the
launch decision?

**Response:** 
They only used a small subset of the available data.
Any data that tried to determine the realtionship with temperature was not used. Even the temp charts for DM, Qm, launches with blowby and challenger were missing about 92% of the temperature data.


**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual evidence
that the "launch was completely outside the engineering database accumulated 
in 24 previous flight." Describe the structure of this data set:

- Number of observations 
- Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of levels). 

**Response:**  
It is a data matrix with history of temperature and O ring damage.
no of observations - 23
Oring damage index - quant (discrete)
Temp - quant (continuous)

**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.  

**Response:** 
The purpose of this paper is to look give a statistical explanation to what went wrong. Essentially Tufte said that visual representaions (since they can be so powerful) should be governed by principles of reasoning about quantitative evidence. We can see witht this case study that just clearly representing things and labelling can help a first time looker of the graph to know what is missing. He puts forward the following principles:
- documenting
-enforcing appropriate comparisons
-demonstrating cause and effect
-expressing quantitatively
- realizing multivariate nature of analytical problems
- inspecting alternate explanations.

If we try to adhere to this we can explore the data well enough to not mislead ourselves and the audience.

## week 2 reading prompts  

Tufte, Edward (1997) The decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger. 
In: *Visual and statistical thinking: Displays of evidence for making
decisions.* Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 16--31.

**Prompt:** Tufte says, "Regardless of the indirect cultural causes of the
accident, there was a clear proximate cause." Summarize Tufte's explanation 
of the proximate cause.  

**Response:** 
While everone was looking at the problem from different angles, Tufte claims the main reason for the failure was the inability to assess the link between link temperatures and O ring damage. He states this with the help of many graphs that were shown before the day of the launch. One of the charts lacked the names of the authors of the chart that might cause lack in credibility. One of them talks about the same rocket with 3 different names which can lead to confusion and issues like these that fail to capture the relationship with temperature.

**Prompt:** Describe the evidence the author presents to support those ideas.

**Response:**  
The first chart does not have names which takes out the possibility of communication and credibility check with the authors. The second chart talks about Oring damage but the chart does not say anything about the cause of the damage (temp). It also has 3 different names for the same rocket so it causes confusion among readers. Another chart talsk about the relationship between erosion of primary ring and secondary ring. it was odd that even this graph the temp is not mentioned although other visual representation is covered.

**Prompt:** What data were used in making the decision to launch? What data 
were not used but should have been used (according to Tufte) in making the
launch decision?

**Response:** 
They only used a small subset of the available data.
Any data that tried to determine the realtionship with temperature was not used. Even the temp charts for DM, Qm, launches with blowby and challenger were missing about 92% of the temperature data.


**Prompt:** On page 23, Tufte presents a graph that provides visual evidence
that the "launch was completely outside the engineering database accumulated 
in 24 previous flight." Describe the structure of this data set:

- Number of observations 
- Data structure: classify each variable as quantitative (continuous or discrete) and categorical (nominal or ordinal and number of levels). 

**Response:**  
It is a data matrix with history of temperature and O ring damage.
no of observations - 23
Oring damage index - quant (discrete)
Temp - quant (continuous)

**Prompt:** Summarize the main thesis of the paper.  

**Response:** 
The purpose of this paper is to look give a statistical explanation to what went wrong. Essentially Tufte said that visual representaions (since they can be so powerful) should be governed by principles of reasoning about quantitative evidence. We can see witht this case study that just clearly representing things and labelling can help a first time looker of the graph to know what is missing. He puts forward the following principles:
- documenting
-enforcing appropriate comparisons
-demonstrating cause and effect
-expressing quantitatively
- realizing multivariate nature of analytical problems
- inspecting alternate explanations.

If we try to adhere to this we can explore the data well enough to not mislead ourselves and the audience.

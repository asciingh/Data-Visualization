## D4 injuries or fatalities displayed ethically  

**Context** 

Type of injury or fatality: Death toll

People affected: Journalists

Over what span of time: 1992-2016



**Graph the data conventionally**

- If you are redesigning someone else's graph, include an image of the original 
- If not, graph the data yourself using a graph type suited to the data  

State the number of observations:  1782

List the variables: 

- death toll 
- time
- type of death (cat)

State the graph type: bar graph

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure: 

- Since we are plotting number of deaths. A bar graph will be able to show clearly when comparing
- bar graphs give us the capability of splitting the data based on subcategories.

Explain the visual-rhetoric features of the graph that make it unethical:  

- point 
- point 
- etc

**Redesign the graph to display the data ethically**

State the new graph type (if any): 

Explain each design choice in the redesign and cite its supporting reference 

- choice, reference 
- choice, reference 
- etc

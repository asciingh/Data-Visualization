# presentation prompts

Complete the prompts before the start of class on the day of the presentation. 

- These points guide the small-group discussions. 
- Much of this work will be part of your portfolio critiques. 

Once you decide the type of graph to be used for a display, you may replace the heading, for example, if you use a box plot for Display D1, you can change the heading from 

    ## D1 distributions 

to 

    ## D1 box plot


## D1 distributions 

State the number of observations: 7197 

List the variables: 

- quantitative var 1 
- quantitative var 2 
- etc 
- categorical var 1 and its levels 
- categorical var 1 and its levels 
- etc 

State the graph type: 

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:  

- point 1 
- point 2 
- etc 

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference 

- choice, reference 
- choice, reference 
- etc 

Comments from peers 

- Does the data structure satisfy the portfolio display requirements?  
- From the Doumont paper, what type of story is being told? 
- Is the graph type suited to the data structure? 
- Other suggestion 
- etc






## D2 multiway 

State the number of observations:  

List the variables: 

- Price ($) - This is the price of the app one has to pay to purchase on the appstore
- user_rating (1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5.....5) - These are the total ratings the app has received over time for all versions 
        - It has 10 levels
- primary_genre (Travel...) - This is the type of application on the app store based on the function it serves.
        - It has 23 unique genres
        

State the graph type:  Multiway Plot

Explain why the graph type is suited to the data structure:  

- Want to look at popular application and their prices and how they vary in different genres.

- Since we are trying to show how price varies in several categories of application based and we also want to show how user ratings affect the price. This is the ideal plot.

Explain each design choice and cite its supporting reference 

- Using only apps with price less than $42
        - getting rid of outliers - better scaling.
        - applications costing are unpopular.
        
- using cont_rating as colour 
        - helps establish relationship between cont rating and price. (if any)
- user_rating - (serves as a test to see if pricing it at that level was successful)

- as a defender....(part of critique) for each variable
- number them on the scale
- colors too dense for gridlines
- annotation line 
- try more ordering
- use teams based on high and low performing teams, another dataframe with the team and players
- add best players on each attribute
- inlcude the other

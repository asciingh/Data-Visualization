##Introduction
The inspiration for this graph comes from personal experience. I have played soccer since a very young age and I have been switched around in team positions based on my changing physical attributes. I used to play attack and as I grew older I moved into the defensive position. My coach at that time said that the reason for the switch was because other players were quicker for the position. I accepted the decision but that made me wonder what physical attributes do I need to have inorder for me to fit the Attack or Defence position.


##Requirement
This graph satisfies d6 requirements:
* Observations - 7491
* Quant variables - Attributes (Agility, Sprint Speed, Acceleration, Strength, Reaction, Jumping , Balance, Stamina)

*Quant variable (y) - Rating (20-100)


##Prose
In order to investigate this, I used the FIFA 19 player dataset. This game has been around for a long time and has been tracking players for almost 2 decades. It is the closest digital representation of player attributes.

First, I looked at the mean of the overall. It seems that the mean ends up being around 65. I also looked at how the data is distributed in the dataset. I chose to take the all the players with an Overall greater that 60. This ensures that we are looking at more developed players and we also ensure we have about 75% of the dataset to avoid bias. Since we are looking at physical attributes, I chose to take players over 18 since by then the body should have mostly developed (speaking in terms of height etc). I chose to look at players in the Forward and Defensive positions only. Since these 2 positions are the exact opposite, it was worth looking into them. I did not take Midfielders because they have mixed rolls on the pitch. There are players like CAM(Center Attacking Mid) which has primarily attacking instructions and there are also players like CDM(Central Defensive Mid) that supports the defense. Even though they have certain roles, midfielders usually end up doing both since they are the leeway between attack and defence. There were also a bunch of other attributes I could have looked at but physical attributes was the aim.

I created the following graph:


```{r setup2, echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
include_graphics("../../../Desktop/School/Senior/Data Visualization/ME447-singhab/figures/fifa19-multivariate-skewed.png")
```


*Display 1: Shows comparison between physical attributes between attack and defensive players*

I coloured the different positions with red and blue. I feel they are pretty distinct. It also maps with the viewers idea of attack (red) and defence (blue). [@RostLC2018b]. I did not make the graph start at 0 since that would shrink it. The point of this is to see what attributes are dominated by what category so I feel it does not mislead.

We can make the following observations:

* Reactions : For this attribute there was no clear winner. We can wee that it is still a very mixed bag. However the range is from 45 to 95 which is interesting to see. I looks like the player has to be above a certain level to attack or defend

* Stamina : We can see that the stamina section is dominated by defenders. We can see blue lines flood the top as well as the bottom. We see that the lines are more dense on the top meaning, defenders end up having more stamina compared to attackers. Having said that, we also see a lot of lines on the bottom side of the section. This means that even though stamina is important, it is not a make or break factor for a defender.

* Strength : This section is highy dominated by defenders. We see that it is extremely dense on top with the blue lines. We also see that the bottom section is filled with attackers. It is safe to say that this is a defining factor for defenders. It makes sense since they are involved with marking and blocking attackers.

* Jumping : This section is again dominated by the defenders. We can see that the attackers have more leeway to get away with not having good jumping but defenders need to be good at it. This also makes sense since defending against corners requires the defenders to jump higher than the attacker. The price is higher to pay if you dont jump while defending than attacking.

* Acceleration and Sprint Speed : Both these attributes represent how quick a player is. Both these categories show that attackers are more inclined to have high values for these categories. We see that the red lines become less and less dense as we fall below 70. The defenders occupy the bottom of the section. We can safely say that this is a very important attributes for attackers.

* Balance : This category shows a dominance of attackers on the top section. The middle section is more mixed. However the bottom section is composed of mostly defenders meaning it is not as important for defenders than attackers.

* Agility: This again is dominated by red on the top of the section and turns mostly blue by the time we get to the bottom. It looks like it is more important for attackers than defenders.

In conclusion, if you are an aspiring attacker. I would suggest you focus on honing your Acceleration, Sprint Speed, Agility, Balance  (in order of importance)and  If you want to be a defender, it makes more sense to hone Strength, Jumping and Stamina. 

Happy Playing!
